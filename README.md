# It_Fights

Project that contains the full implementation of my End-Of-Degree project. It contains a simple but full game engine containing a plethora of subsystems connected by a message bus. It also has a scene dedicated to Top-Down Zelda-like gameplay in which you fight an Agent trained with reinforcement learning techniques by iterating through simulations inside this engine but without rendering.
