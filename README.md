# It_Fights

This is a personal project in which I experiment with creating an engine in C++. As of now I'm working on scene and game object manipulation and I have implemented a messaging system between engine subsystems and a console able to receive and send messages to all of those subsystems.
Some subsystems for things such as input, window management, drawing, shaders, timers, and other stuff have been implemented already :D
